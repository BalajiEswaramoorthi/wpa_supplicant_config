       # This option can be used to allow wpa_supplicant to overwrite configuration
       # file whenever configuration is changed (e.g., new network block is added with
       # wpa_cli or wpa_gui, or a password is changed). This is required for
       # wpa_cli/wpa_gui to be able to store the configuration changes permanently.
       # Please note that overwriting configuration file will remove the comments from
       # it. For this wpa_supplicant should be compiled with out CONFIG_NO_CONFIG_WRITE.
